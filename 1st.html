    <h2>1. George Orwell's 1984 on Goodreads:</h2>
    <img src="book1.jpg"
    height="200"
    width="195">
    <p> 1984 is a powerful and disturbing novel that has earned its place as a classic.  While some readers may find it slow or bleak, its themes remain frighteningly relevant in today's world.  It's a book that will stay with you long after you finish reading it.</p>
    <p>review:</p>
    <p>Joana:-  Having read 1984 some time ago, I felt that some of its deepest ideas might have eluded me while I was reading the book. I guess most people become focused on the nightmare environment of the book and the destiny of its characters (I know I did).

        So, in general, I found this book to be good complementary reading to 1984, since it provided me new perspective on many aspects of the book. Without wanting to go in too much detail, here are some of those aspects: similarities between the protagonist (Smith) and Orwell himself, relationship between Smith and Julia and its several interpretations, and perhaps more surprisingly the optimism latent in 1984.</p>
    <h2>2. Lisa Halliday's Asymmetry:</h2>
    <img src="book2.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>"Asymmetry" is a thought-provoking read that delves into complex relationships and global issues. It's a strong debut for those who appreciate unconventional narratives and literary depth.</p>
    <p>review:</p>
    <p>
        Larry H:- How do you judge a book—do you just consider whether or not you liked it, or do you also take into consideration whether or not the author's attempt at conveying a message worked for you? This dilemma arose for me after reading Lisa Halliday's debut novel, Asymmetry .
        
        The book is unevenly divided into three novellas. I loved the first one, enjoyed parts of the second one, and really didn't understand the purpose of the third one. Since the third novella portrayed a character from the first novella in a rather unflattering (although not unsurprising) light, I didn't enjoy it at all, and kept waiting for something more to happen</p>

    <h2>3. The Power of Habit </h2>
    <img src="book3.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p> The book is well-written and engaging. Duhigg does a great job of making complex scientific concepts understandable to a lay audience. The stories are fascinating and help to illustrate the key points of the book.</p>
    <p>review:</p>
    <p>
        sleeps9hours:- I just read Kelly McGonigal's "The Willpower Instinct", so I can't help but compare the two.

Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.

    <h2>4. Anissa Gray's The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls:</h2>
    <img src="book4.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls is a powerful debut that explores themes of family, forgiveness, and the yearning for connection. With its well-drawn characters and unflinching portrayal of complex emotions, the novel is a captivating read for those who enjoy character-driven stories.</p>
    <p>review:</p>
    <p>Susanne:- Have you ever been so unprepared for a book that you were completely bowled over by it? You start reading and the tears immediately runneth over? A part of you recognizes the angst, the fear and the regret? The inability to communicate the words that should be said but aren’t? Yeah for me, that book was “The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls” by Anissa Gray.</p>
    <h2>5. The Book of M by Peng Shepherd:</h2>
    <img src="book5.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>Peng Shepherd's "The Book of M" is a genre-bending novel that blends elements of dystopian fiction, fantasy, and even a touch of magical realism. Set in a world ravaged by a strange phenomenon that causes people to lose their shadows and memories, the story follows Ory and Max, a couple desperately trying to hold onto their love and each other.</p>
    <p>review:</p>
    <p>Adam Dalva:- Shepherd has crafted a gripping, multi-faceted debut here, a dystopic future novel that goes well past the expectations of the genre. I admired the textual experimentation of this measured book, as various symbols, fonts, and perspectives try to get across the lives of the characters, who mix emotional heft with sudden, rapid action. The leads, Ory and Max, are wonderfully drawn and make for an excellent emotional core.</p>
    <h2>6. To Kill a Mockingbird</h2>
    <img src="book6.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a captivating novel narrated by a young Scout Finch. Through Scout's innocent eyes, we witness the racial tensions of the Deep South as her lawyer father defends a wrongly accused Black man. This coming-of-age story tackles prejudice and justice with enduring themes, making it a must-read despite its slow start and limitations in perspective.</p>
    <p>review:</p>
    <p>leynes:- This is my first re-read of 2017, and I don't regret it one bit. When I first read this book three years ago, I really liked it. Sadly, I didn't write my thoughts down in an elaborate way back in the day, but I know for sure, that I didn't read critically then. Upon my re-read of this book, I honestly don't have good things to say. I am aware that some of my criticism is not a critique of the book itself, but about its perception, and how it is, up to this day, held up as the one true book about race relations in the United States of America.</p>
    <h2>7. Pride And Prejudice by Jane Austen</h2>
    <img src="book7.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>Pride and Prejudice is a novel of manners, romance, and social critique. It subtly examines philosophical ideas through down-to-earth realism and humor.
        The story revolves around Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist, and her interactions with the wealthy and enigmatic Mr. Darcy.</p>
        <p>review:</p>
        <p>Lauren Onak:- Was just reading the third section, Mansfield Park. My last unread Austen novel! So funny and so dark.</p>
        <h2>8. War And peace by Leo Tolstoe</h2>
    <img src="book8.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>War and Peace is often considered one of the greatest novels ever written. Its vast scope, intricate characters, and historical backdrop make it a literary masterpiece.
        The novel spans several decades, capturing the lives of aristocrats, soldiers, and peasants during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
        <p>review:</p>
          <p>Matt:- Whatever else I am, I am the type of person who reads classic novels out of a sense of obligation. Also, I must admit, out of a sense of vanity. My ego, after all, is as fragile as a goldfish and requires the constant attention of a newborn baby. Every once in awhile, it needs a little boost, and the intellectual challenge of Dostoevsky or Dickens can really work wonders.</p>
        <h2>9. Gitanjali by Rabindranath Tagore</h2>
    <img src="book9.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>Gitanjali (which translates to “Song Offerings”) is a collection of translated poems from Tagore’s original Bengali work.
        The English version includes 69 poems, capturing the essence of the Bengali collection</p>

        <p>review:</p>
    <p>Seemita:- There lived a pair of eyes in whose serenity the dawn and dusk merged, in whose voice the wise found their nerves, in whose heart even hatred turned love and in whose thoughts, a nation found their own.</p>
        <h2>10. Midnight's Children by Salman Rushdie</h2>
    <img src="book10.jpg"
    hieght="200"
    width="195">
    <p>Midnight's Children is a novel of epic proportions, blending realism with magical realism.
        The story follows Saleem Sinai, one of the “midnight children” born at the stroke of midnight on India’s independence day in 1947.</p>
        <p>review:</p> 
        <p>Turhan Sarwar:- Midnight's Children is not at all a fast read; it actually walks the line of being unpleasantly the opposite. The prose is dense and initially frustrating in a way that seems almost deliberate, with repeated instances of the narrator rambling ahead to a point that he feels is important--but then, before revealing anything of importance, deciding that things ought to come in their proper order. This use of digressions (or, better put, quarter-digressions) can either be attributed to a charmingly distractable narrator or a vehicle for (perhaps cheaply) tantalizing the reader... or both.</p>
